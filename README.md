# 🚀 HackerthonZeroToHero

Hi! I'm here to document my hackathon journey — from absolute beginner to (hopefully) hero.  
This is my space to stay **consistent**, **disciplined**, and **accountable** as I work through challenges, learn new skills, and build meaningful projects.

## 📅 Week 1: Discovery, Setup, and Inspiration

### 🗓️ Day 1 – Found My First Hackathon!

After exploring a few options, I’ve decided to participate in:

### 🔗 [GNEC Hackathon 2025 Fall](https://gnec-hackathon-2025-fall.devpost.com/)

- **Theme:**  
  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)  
  - **SDG 1:** No Poverty  
  - **SDG 2:** Zero Hunger  

- **Dates:**  
  August 12 – October 12, 2025

- **Mode:**  
  100% Online

- **Why I Chose It:**  
  This is my **first-ever hackathon**, and I couldn’t be more excited.  
  The theme feels meaningful, and the idea of contributing to real-world issues like poverty and hunger really motivates me.  
  I’m also aiming for the internships offered — I truly need one right now, and this could be a life-changing opportunity.  
  I’m ready to give it my best.

## 🧠 Thoughts

> I’m not just doing this for fun (though I hope it *will* be fun).  
> I want to learn, grow, and challenge myself.  
> This is the beginning of something bigger for me.
